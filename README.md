# visualizeKmeans

2019-12-19:
This is the very first shot of a python script to visualize k-means algorithm.
Via terminal one can start:
  - kMeansEngine.py: for a quick launch with default settings
  - kMeansUI.py: for running the engine with user defined settings:
settings:
 - number of samples, 
 - number of initial (random) centers
 - number of max iterations
 - updates per second
