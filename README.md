# visualizeKmeans

2019-12-19:
This is the very first shot of a python script to visualize k-means algorithm.
Via terminal one can start:
  - kMeansEngine.py: for a quick launch with default settings
  - kMeansUI.py: for running the engine with user defined settings: \n
    (number of samples, number of initial (random) centers, number of max iterations, updates per second)
